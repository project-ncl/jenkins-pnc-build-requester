# Jenkins Plugin for Project Newcastle Handover

This plugin facilitates handover from community to productization. It can be used to trigger a corresponding build
in Project Newcastle. If the build configuration associated with the build does not exist, it creates a new build
configuration.

## How to Configure the Plugin

There is global configuration and local configuration. Global configuration can be accessed only by administrators,
local configuration can be accessed by anyone who has permission to configure Jenkins jobs.

### Global Configuration

This configuration allows the administrator to predefine default Project Newcastle Url and Keycloak authentication 
settings. To change the settings, go to "Manage Jenkins" and then select "Configure System". Find section 
"Handover to Productization Configuration" and review or possibly change the settings.

### Activation of the Plugin

To be able to use the plugin, you have to activate the plugin first. To do this, select the configuration of your job, 
scroll to the bottom and add a post-build action named "Configure Handover to Productization". Be aware that you can 
only do this for Maven Jobs.

### Local Configuration

This configuration is used by the plugin to connect to Project Newcastle. Go to the configuration of your job and 
(after activating the plugin, see previous section) you can find section "Configure Handover to Productization". 
You can just review the configuration or change it.

## How to Use the Plugin to Send a Build Request to Project Newcastle

First, you need a successful maven build with the plugin activated. If you successfully built a maven job and the 
plugin was active at the time, you will find "Handover to Prod" menu item in the left panel of the build page. When 
you click on the button, you will be redirected for login and then asked to review and possibly change some build 
information. When you are sure the build information is sound, you can send the request by clicking on "Send Build 
Request".
